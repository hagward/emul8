emul8
=====

This is a basic emulator for the CHIP-8 programming language. I want to thank Laurence Muller for his [excellent article](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) on how to write a basic CHIP-8 emulator, as it has been very helpful in learning how an emulator works and how it can be written.

## Usage

Run it with `java Main.class [rom_file]`. Programs can be paused by pressing `p`, otherwise keybindings are the same as in the linked article; that is: `1234 qwer asdf zxcv`.
